# BUILDING Deep Neural Networks
The course link :http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shavlik/cs638_cs838.html#requirements

Deep neural network at UW-Madison:
Lab1: Train a perceptron, implement bp algorithm, use early stopping to reduce overfitting.
Lab2: Train a fully connected network 'one layer of Hidden Units' ANN, implemented Drop out, weight decay and momentum term.
Lab3: Build a simple deep CNN. Implement Convolution-Pooling-Convolution-Pooling Layers.

Final Project: Finding optimal coding functions for continuous wave time of flight with neural networks. Built network with Keras,  evaluated performance of FCN with GPU.
